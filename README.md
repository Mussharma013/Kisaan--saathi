For the Techy Folks (Who Want to See How It's Built!) 💻
If you're into technology or just curious about how Kisaan Saathi works behind the scenes, here's how you can get it up and running on your own computer. We'd love for you to check it out!

Getting Started with the Code:
Get the Code:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/kisaan-saathi.git
cd kisaan-saathi
Set Up Your Workspace (It's important!):

Bash

python -m venv venv
# On Windows, use this: venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux, use this: source venv/bin/activate
This creates a virtual environment to keep your project's dependencies separate and clean.

Install What You Need (Think of these as ingredients!):

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Little tip: Make sure you have a requirements.txt file in your project. It lists all the Python tools like Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, gTTS, etc. You can generate one by running pip freeze > requirements.txt after you've installed them manually during development.)

Keep It Secure (Very important for safety!):
Create a file named .env in your main project folder (or you can set these in your computer's environment variables, but .env is cleaner):

FLASK_SECRET_KEY="a_super_secret_phrase_for_security"
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY="your_personal_openweathermap_api_key_here"
(You can easily get a free weather API key from openweathermap.org! That's how we get the weather info.)

Database Ready (No fuss!):
You don't need to do any manual setup here! When you run the app the very first time, it will automatically create a file called site.db to handle all your user accounts.

Start It Up! (Let's get this going!):

Bash

flask run
Visit Kisaan Saathi! (Your new app is waiting!):
Open your favorite web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ – and boom! Kisaan Saathi will be running live on your computer!



The Smart Stuff Behind the Scenes (How it all works!) 🧠
The Look and Feel (Frontend Magic): We built what you see and click on using standard web languages you probably know: HTML for the structure, CSS for making it look good, and JavaScript to make everything move and respond.

The App's Brain: Flask, which is a cool tool built with Python, handles all the smart logic that makes Kisaan Saathi run.

Our Data Organizer: SQLite is what we use to securely keep track of all our user information.

Our Special Helpers (Other Tools & Services):

gTTS: This neat tool turns our text answers into spoken words, so you can listen to our AI!

requests: This helps our app "talk" to other online services, like the weather service, to get real-time data.

Flask-SQLAlchemy & Flask-Login: These powerful tools make managing users and their accounts super smooth and, most importantly, very secure.

Font Awesome: We use this for all those clear and crisp icons you see around the app.

OpenWeatherMap API: This is the outside service that provides all that useful, up-to-the-minute weather data.
